# Localization Effort for the Nix Ecosystem

This is an experimental project to understand the scope of potential localization efforts and implementations.

Tentative Implementation using:
- Weblate 
- Either gettext or fluent.

Localization:
- The nix manual (`components/nix-manual`)

#### General Notes

### The nix manual
- Has some preprocessing steps, we ignore them for now, for the sake of simplicity.
